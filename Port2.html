        <h2>About Me
        </h2>
        <p float: right;>
              I have changed directions several times. I recently left Providence
              on Glisan where I was a professional vampire to program. Before
              that I did honors research in neuroscience at PSU and presented my
              findings in Germany. I have always dabbled in trying to program -
              however I lacked the kind of people around me that might've been
              helpful and I tend to be better at focusing when I am not working
              full time and have incentive outside of myself. I have a dozen
              ideas for programs, apps, and changing things that will have to be
              listed another day.
