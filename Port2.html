        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p float: right;>
              I have changed directions several times. I recently left Providence on Glisan where I was a professional vampire to program. Before that I did honors research in neuroscience at PSU and presented my findings in Germany.                     I have always dabbled in trying to program - however I lacked the kind of people around me that might've been helpful and I tend to be better at focusing when I am not working full time and have incentive outside of myself. I have a dozen ideas for programs, apps, and changing things that will have to be listed another day.

            <h4>Interests and Hobbies</h4>
            <p>I enjoy video games, anime tv shows, and puzzles. I can solder, juggle badly, and draw blood better than most people in the state of Oregon if not the country. </p>
